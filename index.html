        content="ReceptorGPT is an AI-powered app that uses Transformer-based protein language models to help you identify TCR matches, discover antigen specificity, and predict TCR structure. ReceptorGPT leverages embeddings to represent TCR sequences in a more compact and informative way, allowing it to query a database of paired TCRs with known antigen specificity and identify matches more efficiently. It can also be used to predict TCR structure." />
